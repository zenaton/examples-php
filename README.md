# Zenaton examples for PHP
This repository contains examples of workflows built with Zenaton. These examples illustrates how Zenaton orchestrates tasks that are executed on different workers.

## Installation
Download this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php.git; cd-examples-php
```

then populate your .env file with your application id and api token found [here](https://zenaton.com/app/api).

### Running on Docker
Simply run
```
docker-compose build; docker-compose up
```

You're all set!

### Running locally
Install dependencies
```
composer install
```
then, you need to install a Zenaton worker
```
curl https://install.zenaton.com | sh
```
and start it, and make it listen to your configuration:
```
zenaton start; zenaton listen --env=.env --boot=autoload.php
```
Your all set!


*Your workflows will be processed by your worker, so you won't see anything except the stdout and stderr, respectively `zenaton.out` and `zenaton.err`. Look at these files :)*

## Example 1 : Sequential tasks execution
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/SequentialWorkflow.php) showcases
- A sequential execution of three tasks. The second and third tasks are executed only when the previous one is processed.
- In a sequential task execution, you can get the output of a task. The result of a task can be used by the next one.

</p>

```php
php bin/launch_sequential.php
```

## Example 2: Parallel tasks execution
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/ParallelWorkflow.php) showcases
- a parallel execution of 2 tasks
- a third task that is executed only after *both* first two tasks were processed

    />
</p>

```php
php bin/launch_parallel.php
```

## Example 3: Asynchronous tasks execution
[this example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/AsynchronousWorkflow.php) showcases
- Asynchronous executions of Task A and Task B (fire and forget)
- Then sequential executions of Task C and Task D.

        alt="Asynchronous Workflow Diagram"
    />
</p>

```php
php bin/launch_asynchronous.php
```
When a task is dispatched asynchronously, the workflow continues its execution without waiting for the task completion. Consequently, a task asynchronous dispatching always returns a null value.

## Example 4: Event
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/EventWorkflow.php) showcases
- how to change a workflow's behaviour based on an external event

        width="400px"
        alt="Event Workflow Diagram"
    />
</p>

```php
php bin/launch_event.php
```

## Example 5: Wait
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/WaitWorkflow.php) showcases
- how the provided `Wait` task can be used to pause the workflow for a specified duration

<p align="center">
    <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenaton/resources/master/examples/images/png/flow_wait.png"
        width="400px"
        alt="Wait Workflow Diagram"
    />
</p>

```php
php bin/launch_wait.php
```

## Example 6: Wait Event
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/WaitEventWorkflow.php) showcases
- how the provided `Wait` task can also be used to pause the workflow up to receiving a specific external event

<p align="center">
    <img
        src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenaton/resources/master/examples/images/png/flow_wait_event.png"
        width="400px"
        alt="WaitEvent Workflow Diagram"
    />
</p>

```php
php bin/launch_wait_event.php
```

## Example 7: Recursive Workflow
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Recursive) showcases
- how launching events or workflows directly from orchestrated tasks allows you to schedule recurring workflows

```php
php bin/launch_recursive.php
```

## Example 8: Workflow Versions
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/src/Workflows/VersionWorkflow.php) showcases
- how to update your workflow implementation, even while previous versions are still running

```php
php bin/launch_version.php
```

## Example 9: Managing Errors
[This example](https://github.com/zenaton/examples-php/tree/master/Workflows/ErrorWorkflow.php) showcases
- how a failed task appear on Zenaton website
- how to retry a failed task using the retry button

    />
</p>

```php
php launch_error.php
```
